  { "question": "Does air conditioning increase fuel consumption?", "answer": "Yes. AC can raise fuel use by roughly 5‑10 % in city driving. Use cabin ventilation or open windows at low speed if possible." },
  { "question": "What's the difference between petrol and diesel efficiency?", "answer": "Diesel engines are roughly 15 % more thermally efficient, but diesel fuel may cost more and engines need different maintenance and emissions controls." },

  { "question": "What tyre pressure gives best fuel economy?", "answer": "Always use the manufacturer’s recommended pressure (found on the door jamb or manual). Under‑inflated tyres can increase fuel use by up to 3 %." },
  { "question": "Does aggressive acceleration waste fuel?",    "answer": "Yes. Rapid starts and heavy throttle can lower mileage by 15‑30 % in stop‑and‑go traffic." },
  { "question": "Is premium petrol worth it for my car?",      "answer": "Only if your car’s owner’s manual says premium is required. Otherwise, it gives no efficiency benefit." },
  { "question": "How often should I change my engine air filter?", "answer": "Typically every 12,000–15,000 km or as recommended. A clogged filter can reduce performance and mileage." },

  { "question": "Effect of 4×4 mode on mileage?",             "answer": "Engaging four‑wheel drive adds drivetrain drag and can lower fuel economy by 5–10 %." },
  { "question": "How accurate is the dashboard fuel computer?", "answer": "Most trip computers are within ±5 %, but manual ‘fill‑and‑divide’ remains the most accurate." },

  { "question": "Can low tyre tread hurt efficiency?",         "answer": "Very low tread can slightly reduce rolling resistance, but safety is vastly more important—replace worn tyres." },
  { "question": "Does ethanol blend lower mileage?",           "answer": "Ethanol contains ~33 % less energy per litre, so E10 gives about 3 % lower mileage than pure petrol." },
  { "question": "Do fuel stabilizers work?",                   "answer": "They slow oxidation and are useful for storage over 3 months, but don’t improve regular driving mileage." },
  { "question": "Why does my car smell of fuel on cold start?", "answer": "Rich cold‑start mixture can let unburned fuel exit the exhaust. If the smell persists, have the system checked." },
  { "question": "How to store petrol safely?",                 "answer": "Use approved containers, fill to 95 % to allow expansion, store in a cool ventilated area away from ignition sources." },

  { "question": "Best driving app for fuel tracking?",         "answer": "Apps like Fuelio, Drivvo, or simply a spreadsheet help log fill‑ups and calculate mileage." },

  { "question": "What is engine ‘lugging’ and why avoid it?",  "answer": "Lugging is running at low rpm in a high gear. It strains the engine and can use more fuel than down‑shifting." },
  { "question": "Do performance chips improve fuel economy?",  "answer": "Most tuning chips prioritise power. Some ‘eco’ tunes can help, but only if accredited; many claims are exaggerated." },
  { "question": "Is coasting in neutral safe?",                "answer": "Modern cars already cut fuel on closed throttle while in gear. Coasting in neutral sacrifices engine braking and can be unsafe." },

  { "question": "Can wind direction change mileage?",          "answer": "A strong headwind increases drag and reduces economy; a tailwind does the opposite." },
  { "question": "What is BS6 / Euro 6 fuel?",                  "answer": "It refers to tighter sulphur limits and emissions norms. Using compliant fuel protects emission‑control systems." },

  { "question": "Why is my fuel gauge dropping fast after half tank?", "answer": "Many gauges are non‑linear; the top half often lasts longer than the bottom due to sender unit geometry." },

  { "question": "How do hybrid cars save fuel?",               "answer": "They recover braking energy, shut the engine during idle, and use an efficient Atkinson‑cycle engine plus electric assist." },
  { "question": "Can using the wrong engine oil grade affect mileage?", "answer": "Too thick oil increases friction; too thin may reduce protection. Use the SAE grade specified by the manufacturer." },
  { "question": "How does turbocharging influence fuel efficiency?", "answer": "A downsized turbo engine can be more efficient under light load, but boost pressure under heavy throttle may negate savings." },
  { "question": "Does a clean car really save fuel?",          "answer": "Minor. Removing dirt or drag‑inducing accessories can improve aerodynamics slightly; benefits are small but real for high‑speed travel." },
  { "question": "Why do short trips hurt mileage?",            "answer": "Engines stay in the warm‑up phase longer, running richer. Catalytic converter and lubricants don’t reach optimal temps." },

  { "question": "What is the purpose of an oxygen sensor?",    "answer": "It measures exhaust O₂ to adjust the fuel‑air mixture. A failing sensor can worsen mileage by up to 20 %." },
  { "question": "How often to check tyre pressure?",           "answer": "At least once a month and before long trips. Pressure can drop 1 PSI for every 5 °C temperature fall." },

  { "question": "Can clogged brakes reduce fuel efficiency?",  "answer": "Dragging brakes create rolling resistance and can cut mileage drastically. Inspect pads and calipers for sticking." },
  { "question": "How do EVs compare in ‘fuel’ cost per km?",   "answer": "Based on electricity rates, EVs often cost 60–80 % less per km than petrol, though this varies with tariffs." },

  { "question": "Are fuel system cleaners necessary?",         "answer": "Top‑tier fuels already contain detergents. Use cleaners only if you suspect injector fouling or follow manufacturer advice." },

  { "question": "Can spark‑plug gap affect economy?",          "answer": "Yes. Incorrect gap causes misfires or weak sparks. Follow spec when replacing or regapping plugs." },
  { "question": "Do tailgate spoilers help fuel economy?",     "answer": "Some factory‑designed spoilers can reduce drag, but add‑on wings often increase drag unless wind‑tunnel tested." },

  { "question": "How does regenerative braking work?",        "answer": "Hybrids/EVs use the motor as a generator to convert kinetic energy to electricity, reducing fuel/electricity use." },
  { "question": "Why does my mileage drop with ethanol‑free fuel?", "answer": "Pure petrol has more energy; you should see slightly *higher* mileage. If not, check tyre pressure and driving style." },
  { "question": "Can old fuel cause poor mileage?",            "answer": "Stale petrol oxidizes and loses volatility, causing poor combustion. Drain and refill if fuel is > 6 months old." },
  { "question": "Do car washes improve mileage?",              "answer": "A clean surface reduces drag minutely; effect is tiny but real at motorway speeds." },
  { "question": "What is engine brake‑specific fuel consumption (BSFC)?", "answer": "It’s the grams of fuel burned per kWh of power—lower BSFC equals higher efficiency." },

  { "question": "Does four‑wheel alignment affect fuel usage?", "answer": "Misalignment creates drag and uneven tyre wear, lowering mileage. Align wheels annually or after impacts." },
  { "question": "How to store diesel in winter?",             "answer": "Use winter‑grade diesel or anti‑gel additives, keep tanks full, and store in a cool dry place." },

  { "question": "How do fuel vapour leaks affect mpg?",       "answer": "Loss of vapour pressure causes venting; ECU compensates with richer mixture, wasting fuel." },

  { "question": "Is AC recirculation mode more efficient?",   "answer": "Yes. Recirculating cooler cabin air reduces AC workload versus pulling hot outside air." },
